# Hi there! 🌱

I'm an European woman, my roots are in the historical country of Italy and my branches have been shaped by the several experiences around the world, living country, cultures and people. 

I am an Environmental Scientist by training. My path has been shaped by the passion for mountains. My first project was into the monerals that constituet this eart, followed by projects in the Alpine and Arctic lakes. To then come to the terrestrial envirometns where still the interest are those somewhat harsh enviromets. 

How can species live in such difficult enviroments? How cna they thrive there? 

the impacts of climate change on Alpine and Arctic ecosystems. 🏔️

🌍 I'm passionate about open and #FAIR research, fostering an inclusive and collaborative research culture.
